> A proof of concept web app to find friends to go to local concerts with based on your music listening history. It was built using Ruby on Rails, a Postgres database, HTML, Javascript, custom SCSS and and bootstrap as a frontend components library. It relies on the Spotify API for users' listening history and the Bandsintown API for concert data. It was made in 2 weeks and presented as a final project for batch #966 of the Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp in Melbourne on September 23rd 2022.
